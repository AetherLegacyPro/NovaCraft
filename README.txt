Welcome to the Rewrite of Cave & Cliff Fundamentals, now called NovaCraft.

This Mod's main goal is to expand upon the base game and make Survival/Hardcore Mode more challenging for experienced players and to expand upon the base game in a way that does not strive too far from vanilla.

For rules I go by when working on NovaCraft, no new dimensions or biomes as I want to expland upon the realms which are already here. 
In addition no new GUIS(extentions to ones in vanilla are fine though) as I rather players interact in the world like with farming, exploring, or with strange interactions like throwing an item into the void to get something back.

**NOTE**: I am working on my version of the Ancient City for V1.4 of NovaCraft which will hopefully be out soon, I still need to finish up the weapon/armor rebalancing and add in the Prisoner content.
- While not as unique and cool as in 1.19 there will be no vibration mechanic as I have no idea how to add that(leaving that for Roadhog360 or his many contributors to figure out at some point in Et Futurum Requiem as they would manage it with 1-1 parity) 
- Some of the blocks are missing as well but there will different versions of the Ancient City one made out the deepslate from Et Futurum Requiem or grimstone in the config.
- Basically it will be more like a massive ruined underground dungeon with spawners, traps and actual loot.
- Hostiles mobs do spawn in and around the structure naturally; no idea how to change this...
- The Warden Altar will be moved here with an outline on how to summon him.
- There is also new buildings/ruins in the city pertaining to features in NovaCraft.
- Plan is to have it be a rare structure that may or may not have an entrance on the surface to help locate one.
- Plan is to have post Nether exploration in progression but honestly should be explored after traveling to the End as it is quite difficult since I plan to have mini-bosses to keep an eye out for when exploring it.


**Main Features of The Mod**

1) Complete Overhaul to Ore Generation

- Ores generate more rarely overhaul but will generate more commonly within caves to encourage Cave Exploration

- Y levels at which Ores will generate have been altered

- Gravel will not be found below y=32 in generation anymore and dirt blobs are completely removed

- Diamond Ore is rarer in world generation

- Similar to 1.18, Coal Ore does not generate at low y levels (Only generates above y=24)

- Iron and Coal Ore try to generate within stone above y=90 again and rarely gold and emerald can be found as well



2) New Cave Decor and Structures

- Sculk Blocks and Sculk plants can be found at low y-levels in the overworld (NOTE: Sculk does not function in the same way as in vanilla, read the changelog for more information)

- 3 Different Types of Lichen, New mushrooms, cave stalagmites and stalactites
- 5 Different types of Geos can be found, some are rarer than others (Very important for progression in the Mod)

- Sculk Geos are basically dungeons but more challenging, there are a few variations of it

- Vindicator Settlements(They generate on the surface in most overworld biomes)



3) Mobs

- There are many new mobs in the mod, all but 3 are hostile as of V1.1

- Many of them can be found within the caves, others are found in the Nether, and the most challenging ones are found in the End.

- These mobs are quite powerful, so do not underestimate them

- The spawn rates of all Vanilla Overworld and Nether mobs have been increased



4) Expansion of the End Dimension

- NOTE: Many of the new End features are based to be played along side Hardcore Ender Expansion

- The End has been made a much more challenging/punishing dimension overhaul
- Depending on the mob, they can kill you in 1-4 hits in Unenchanted Diamond Armor, so you will need to actually prepare when traveling to this realm
- Blobs of Endstone and Frontierstone can be found throughout the End now
- A new "tree" type, flora, new ores and blocks have been added to the dimension
- Much of the mod is locked behind obtaining specific resources in the End, look at the achievements page for help on where something may be located






For goal driven players, the main goal is to fight the Warden (vastly different fight compared to in 1.19) to acquire the materials to create your own custom End Portal(NOTE: In 1.7.10 there are only 3 strongholds per world and sometimes the portal room is not connected to the body of the stronghold) and the final tier right now, Crystalite. You can also x9 Duplicate many types of ores, the legendary beacon and enchantment table are also some nice goals to work toward in the mod. The Deep One and The Bloviator are other bosses that you should work toward.

There will be more things to do after fighting the Warden in later build of the mod.

- Special thanks to both Roadhog360(main author of Et Futurum Requiem) and Delirus(author of Netherlious) for all their help with the code and helping me troubleshoot issues I have had during development.

This mod would not be anywhere close to what I envisioned and it would not have nearly as many features so go check out both of their mods out.
